# WEIGHT LOSS TRACKER

## :scroll:DESCRIPTION

While developing the Weight tracker, I expanded my skills to include charting support. I used ChartJS for this purpose. Users can add their current weight daily and thus monitor it easily. You can also add your goal with an exact date which will be displayed on the chart. In case of input error, we can delete any of the data entered. I used Firebase Authentication to handle the registration and Firebase Realtime Database to store the data.
