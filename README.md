## About Weight Tracker


While developing the Weight tracker, I expanded my skills to include
charting support. I used ChartJS for this purpose. Users can add their
current weight daily and thus monitor it easily. You can also add your
goal with an exact date which will be displayed on the chart. In case of
input error, we can delete any of the data entered. I used Firebase
Authentication to handle the registration and Firebase Realtime
Database to store the data.
